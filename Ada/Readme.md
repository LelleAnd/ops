# Ada OPS Implementation #

The Ada implementation has taken its first steps.

For now the basic OPS objects exists and the **opsc** IDL-compiler can generate Ada code for IDL objects and the needed factories.

The implementation uses some features from Ada 2012.

The implementation has only been tested with **GNAT GPS 2016**.

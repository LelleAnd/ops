# Delphi OPS Implementation #

The Delphi implementation is now almost in pair with the C++ implementation regarding functionality. It is somewhat limited in functionality regarding Deadline Timers, Reservable messages and the XMLArchiver, but it can now use all types of Transports.

The implementation uses generics which arrived in Delphi 2009.
The implementation has so far only been tested with **Delphi XE2** but should also work with any later version if the **Sockets unit** still exist.

Full support for the OPS functionality (same as for C++) will be added in the near future.

# Delphi OPS Implementation #

The Delphi implementation is now in pair with the C++ implementation regarding functionality.

The implementation uses generics which arrived in Delphi 2009 and namespaces that requires Delphi XE2.
The implementation has only been tested with **Delphi XE2** and **Delphi 10.1 Berlin** Starter Edition, but should work with any version from Delphi XE2 and forward.

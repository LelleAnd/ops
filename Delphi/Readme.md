# Delphi OPS Implementation #

This is a first version of OPS for Delphi. It is still limited in functionality and so far only supports Multicast transport (which is the default one in OPS).

The implementation uses generics which arrived in Delphi 2009.
The implementation has so far only been tested with **Delphi XE2** but should also work with any later version.

Full support for the OPS functionality (same as for C++) will be added in the near future.

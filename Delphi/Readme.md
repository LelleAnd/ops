# Delphi OPS Implementation #

The Delphi implementation is now in pair with the C++ implementation regarding functionality.

The implementation uses generics which arrived in Delphi 2009.
The implementation has so far only been tested with **Delphi XE2** but should also work with any later version up to and including **Delphi XE5**. In **Delphi XE6** the **Sockets** (web.win.sockets) unit was removed and replaced with a non-compatible unit.

A version dependent implementation of Ops will soon be added that adds support for the latest version of Delphi (**Delphi 10.1 Berlin**).

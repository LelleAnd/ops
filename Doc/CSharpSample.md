# Interfacing OPS with C# #

Look in your folder "OPS\_DIR/Examples/OPSIdls/\*/Generated/CSharp". Here you will find the C# code generated when compiling the different IDL examples with the IDLCompiler.

Use your choice of Visual Studio to open up "OPS\_DIR/Examples/CSharpApps/\*/\*.sln"
Examine the samples and build and run them to see how they work.

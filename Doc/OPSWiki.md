The idea of OPS is not unique, it is highly inspired by OMG's [DDS](http://portals.omg.org/dds) (Data Distribution Service) specification both in terms of functionality, API's, ideas and terminology. What OPS offers is an easier to learn and use variant than the DDS specification and its implementations available. Moreover, by using simple threading models and protocol, the OPS core is easy to understand both in terms of learning to use it, but also to understand what consequences it has on the systems that use it. By offering plugin mechanisms, OPS still ensures that complicated distributed systems with unique demands can be targeted.

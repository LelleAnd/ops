        Received UDP and MC packets are transfered to the communication endpoint using the choosen transport mechanism. 
        As default UDP packets will be resent using address "127.0.0.1" and the receive port. 
        As default MC packets will be resent using the receive MC address and port. 
        If the address and/or port for a send need to be changed, the translation can be specified on the sending side.

          ip        MC / UDP address that the bridge should listen to.
